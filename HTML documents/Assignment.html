		<p>Here is a dog fact from: https://www.purina.co.uk/ </p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.purina.co.uk/dogs/behaviour-and-training/understanding-dog-behaviours/amazing-dog-facts">
		This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have. Why are dogs noses wet? Vetstreet says that the answer is that dogâ€™s noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals! Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.
